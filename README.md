# AppController

This is a Old Mini project that i was working on for some hours, the purpose of this project was to stop me from playing and watching youtube soo mutch and consequently work more.

To make this program work without any visual console i used pyinstaller :

* pyinstaller --noconsole wind.py

Since for a long time i'm using linux ,this project is just reminder of the old projects that i was working on!
